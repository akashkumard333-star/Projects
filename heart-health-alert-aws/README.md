# 🫀 Heart Health Alert System  
### End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline Using AWS EMR, SageMaker, Lambda, SNS, Athena, and S3

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project implements a complete cloud-based **heart attack risk prediction and alerting system** using Amazon Web Services.  
It simulates patient vitals, processes health data at scale, trains an **XGBoost model**, generates real-time predictions with **AWS Lambda**, triggers alerts via **Amazon SNS**, and enables analytics using **Amazon Athena**.

The system mirrors how modern hospitals and remote patient-monitoring platforms use **cloud-native machine learning pipelines** for proactive cardiac risk assessment.

## 📊 Final Deliverables

### **1. End-to-End AWS ML Pipeline**
A fully operational pipeline integrating:
- **Amazon S3** – Data lake & ingestion  
- **AWS EMR (Spark)** – Distributed preprocessing  
- **Amazon SageMaker** – Model training & deployment  
- **AWS Lambda** – Automated real-time inference  
- **Amazon SNS** – High-risk alerts  
- **Amazon Athena** – Analytics & reporting
